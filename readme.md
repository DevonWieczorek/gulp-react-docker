This is a test project to find a way to keep an entire workflow to a docker container to avoid convoluting the local machine. 

Gulpfile setup is mainly inspired by https://jonsuh.com/blog/integrating-react-with-gulp/

Docker container is inspired by http://jdlm.info/articles/2016/03/06/lessons-building-node-app-docker.html

It is not meant to be ready for anything, perhaps a boiler plate for getting started with the development of an app and not needing to set everything up and figuring everything out. But mainly a tool to be inspired to create your own to save some hair on the top of your head. Also a place for learning.
